# Mongoose Sample

It's based on [this post](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/).

You'll need to provide your own connection string in a `.env` with a 🔑 of `MONGO_URL`, which will be used [the config file](https://github.com/manavm1990/node-mongo-mongoose-sample/blob/main/app/config.js) with `dotenv`.

Or, just refer back to original post to keep it more plain without architecture 🏗️.
